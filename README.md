## Hey! ðŸ‘‹ :shipit:

Bringing a dynamic approach from my experience in Biomedical Science, I have a deep appreciation for the experimental methods that underpin development. I enjoy looking at problems critically and coming up with exciting solutions to them whilst collaborating on projects, to ensure efficient, functional and robust code.
