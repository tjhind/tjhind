Based on the idea that cinema tickets are often too expensive to make cinema an accessible experience for all, and that many tickets go unsold (just check your local cinema's website!), TicketDash is a mobile app providing live auctioning for cinema tickets on both iOS and Android. It's a platform where businesses can list events and seats for auction at a lower price and users can bid on tickets for those seats in real time. Myself and 4 other developers built this app from scratch in just 8 days. 

* Developed in React Native and with Expo
* Utilises web sockets for live auctioning functionality
* PostgreSQL database, with earthdistance & cube modules to show a user events in a radius from their given location
* Server-side scheduling that closes the auction after a given time and updates user and event statuses
* Unique QR code tickets (SVG images) are generated by a React Native extension when the user wins the auction
